# This is the Mercurius Explain Graphiql Plugin

## Pre-requirements

Run `npm i` to install all the packages

## Running locally

You need to start the server of mercurius on port `3001` and not set the property `graphiql` or set it to `false`.
Run `npm start` that will start the development server.
Now the application is running on `http://localhost:3000` and will access the mercurius server on `http://localhost:3001`
